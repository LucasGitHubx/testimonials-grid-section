          so, in the company I joined. I Honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

        <p>" I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
          experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it 
          incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best
          - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
          successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "</p>
